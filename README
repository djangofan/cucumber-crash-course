Here is a quick end-to-end Cucumber example of how to perform a web test in a headless fashion using Selenium through Capybara.

It is perfect for running on a CI server (e.g. Jenkins) or locally.

The example scenario is simple -- go to Google, search for "Hello World!", and verify that you got results containing that text.

Happy Testing!
